### Extract CDS regions from the T2T-CHM13v2.0 reference

We generated bed files of CDS regions in T2T-CHM13v2.0 using the feature table available on NCBI ftp site and the gff information. This would enable us to:

1. TODO: See the differences of coverage of CDS regions between GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13v2.0
2. TODO: Compare variant calls for a control sample within these regions between GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13v2.0
