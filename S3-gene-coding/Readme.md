### Generate gene coding sequence beds for CHM13v2.0

- Script (modified for CHM13v2.0) - https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle/genome-stratifications/blob/master/GRCh38/FunctionalRegions/create_GRCh38_cds_bed.Rmd
- Input: CHM13v2.0 fasta, feature table, gff available on NCBI ftp site.
- Output: BED file containing regions of CHM13v2.0 that are gene coding sequences

We have so far generated the bed files of CDS regions in T2T-CHM13v2.0 using the above input. This would enable us to:

1. TODO: See the differences of coverage of CDS regions between GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13v2.0 by generating plots
2. TODO: Compare variant calls for a control sample within these regions between GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13v2.0
